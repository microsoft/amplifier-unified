# Contributor operating guidance

## Assess scope and design before taking on issues or PRs

User direction, October 13, 2026: an issue or PR is a proposal, not an automatic
commitment. Before implementing, sponsoring an upstream change, or calling it a
release prerequisite, verify that it affects Amplifier Unified's actual runtime
and dependencies. Shared naming is not evidence of dependency. In particular,
Amplifier Agent is separate from Unified's Core/Foundation runtime.

- Check the problem against `docs/architecture/VISION.md`, the applicable client
  vision, and the relevant contracts. Identify the canonical owner and evidence.
- Confirmed defects in promised behavior normally warrant straightforward fixes.
- New features and behavior or architecture changes require judgment about whether
  they are desirable, their general client needs, and the right design; do not
  accept the issue's proposed implementation by default.
- Any intentional change in direction must update the governing vision/contracts
  explicitly as part of the proposal before implementing the divergent behavior.
- Keep unrelated upstream improvements separate from Unified release gates.
  Close out-of-scope tracking and correct misleading reviews when discovered.

## Make performance changes reviewable

For changes to repeated reads, publication, persistence or runtime preparation,
follow [performance validation](docs/validation/performance.md). Identify the
canonical owner, triggering operation and inputs that grow before choosing an
optimization. Review work done before filtering or sending a response, including
history reads, copies, scans and encoding. Retain a focused regression check for
the demonstrated cost and the affected history, authority and recovery semantics.
Use measured workload budgets; this does not add a full-suite release gate.

## Keep the development release loop fast

Every release needs an authored What's new entry, including fixes-only and
maintenance releases. Before choosing a version or preparing a release PR,
follow [version choice and release notes](docs/validation/release-qualification.md#version-choice-and-release-notes).
The release owner checks the shipped changes and high-impact guidance; a version
bump and passing format validator alone are not a complete release summary.

User direction, October 14, 2026: keep the foreground development-to-release loop
to a few minutes. Qualify affected behavior locally in the owned DTU, retaining
exact-source evidence and explicit limits. Aim for 1–3 minutes of focused checks
and about five minutes for the normal local budget. Run relevant browser/runtime
smoke tests; do not make the full local suite a merge or release prerequisite.
Use specific pre-release checks for material risks such as destructive migrations
or changed authorization, instead of automatically running every unrelated test.

Keep publication on the short package/frontend/native-runtime path, targeting
roughly two minutes when warm. Broad readiness, full Python and extended browser
coverage runs automatically after publication and reports failures for follow-up.
Do not add exhaustive PR/main/publication gates without an explicit decision and
an update to [the release policy](docs/validation/release-qualification.md).
Published does not mean post-release checks passed. Investigate failures and ship
corrections; never move published tags or replace released bytes to hide a failure.

Full suites, broad browser/platform coverage and stress tests run in the background.
Delegate their monitoring and triage and continue foreground work as soon as the
release is published. Report actionable changes, not routine polling. Fold failures
into the next release when one is in progress, or address them directly when idle;
newly discovered urgent regressions still warrant prompt attention. Reuse verified
qualification only when the exact tested inputs match the candidate being shipped;
changed inputs require the affected checks again.

## Bundled client and server evolve together

User direction, October 14, 2026: the web client ships with the server. Change
bundled interfaces together and remove superseded bundled paths; do not add
old-bundle compatibility fallbacks or capability negotiation. Independently
released clients, custom components, and explicit public APIs have their own
contracts and version policies. Preserve or deliberately revise those contracts
with their owners instead of silently changing their promised behavior.

## Interactive archive boundary

Keep archive feedback/navigation in the bundled interactive controls, not the
public `session.archive` action. Qualify late-response navigation races, the
noncurrent-chat path, Undo, and the raw action's selection-preserving behavior.
Release the interactive mutation lock on its confirmed receipt, independently of
navigation. Qualify stalled navigation with usable Undo and superseding intent.
