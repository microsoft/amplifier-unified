# Managed Git worktrees

A small reusable Git library for inspect/create/attach/status/remove. It accepts
bounded argv and never invokes a shell. Repository hooks and external diff
helpers are disabled. A file lock in the common Git directory serializes
participating hosts; Git retains its own branch/worktree locking. It performs no
fetch, push, merge, reset, or forced deletion.

Create requires the exact inspected source revision (HEAD, index/worktree diffs,
untracked content hashes). Default mode starts a clean detached checkout from a
committed ref; a requested new branch uses ordinary Git ownership checks. An
explicit `carry_dirty` copies staged/unstaged patches and nonignored untracked
regular files/symlinks. It requires current HEAD and refuses unmerged indexes,
submodules, and index flags it cannot preserve. Originals are never changed.
Untracked capture is bounded to 2000 files / 20 MB; each Git output is bounded to
20 MB and each Git invocation to 30 seconds.

Private durable JSON records and source manifests precede mutation. Patch bytes,
hashes and untracked evidence are retained under the manifest evidenceDirectory.
A partial attempt remains inspectable and is never replayed automatically. Stable
command identities deduplicate create/attach/remove. Existing checkouts may be
attached but do not acquire deletion ownership. App-created cleanup verifies
current repository/path ownership and refuses changed, untracked or ignored files.
Unreferenced detached commits must be retained on a branch/tag or another worktree
before removal. It preserves branches, source folders, manifests and history. The host supplies
active-task/handoff guards and explicit user intent; this library owns no runtime
or permission controller.

Managed storage must be outside the source checkout. This avoids storing the
manifest itself among the source files being copied. A checkout can be a source
for another checkout under the same managed parent.
