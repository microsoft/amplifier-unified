# Amplifier Web Client

A browser interface for [Amplifier Unified](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified):
conversations, workspaces, tool activity and interactive work surfaces. The client
connects to a host over the current HTTP/SSE/WebSocket interfaces; the host owns
agent execution and durable conversation history.

To run the packaged application, follow
[Amplifier Unified's installation guide](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified#readme).
This repository is for developing the web client as an independent component.

## Status

This experimental extraction preserves the client history from Unified v0.70.0
(`4854dbd9ec555690269747b7dbe273f008e9e179`, `LICENSE` and `frontend/`).
The browser interface matches accepted Unified main
`5692ad7bb7b79e0a000ccc7415cd0ac97d58738e`, preserving the current HTTP/SSE
behavior. Version `0.3.3` removes the automatic legacy-message notice and
retained-copy badge from ordinary chat. Old unbound copies remain stored and
inert; current messages keep their exact-source delivery checks and recovery
controls. No message is automatically resent, rebound or deleted.
It retains the accepted secondary-sidebar refinements, reset-cleanup interface
and canonical client-test ownership. Backend reset behavior is qualified by
Unified `0.74.0`, not by standalone client fixtures. This presentation
simplification requires a qualified client selection before Unified delivery.
The 14 canonical shared inputs are selected from accepted Unified main
`816c7a67dbafc20bfb28723dd317c71d3bd2bb28`; their bytes still match the current
accepted server. Shared-input provenance and actual server qualification are distinct.
The repository is currently private; preserve its visibility. Its independent package is
`@amplifier/client-web`, currently `0.3.3`; this candidate's private GitHub artifact publication
and Unified release adoption remain separate. Client source and tests are authored here. Unified owns selection, host integration
checks and distribution assembly; its temporary delivery copy and disposable
prepared tree are consumers of this source. The retained AHP client is separate.
While private, client changes intended for Unified require both repositories or
a named integration handoff; see [temporary dual-repository maintenance](#temporary-dual-repository-maintenance).

The [family vision](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/816c7a67dbafc20bfb28723dd317c71d3bd2bb28/docs/architecture/VISION.md),
[component boundaries](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/816c7a67dbafc20bfb28723dd317c71d3bd2bb28/contracts/component-boundaries.v1.md) and
[client development contract](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/816c7a67dbafc20bfb28723dd317c71d3bd2bb28/contracts/client-development.v1.md)
remain the canonical promises. This first extraction preserves the current wire
and declares exactly one server revision per artifact; it adds no negotiation,
compatibility fallback, SDK owner or updater.

## Build and try the independent artifact

Use Node 22 and an owned test environment. Prepare the 14 shared files selected
by `build-inputs.lock.json`: catalogs, the shell SDK, branding and their licenses.
Run `npm run prepare:inputs` here to fetch only the pinned public files
anonymously. No clone, token or private repository access is required. Each
request has a timeout and locked byte/hash limits; failed retrieval preserves
the previous prepared inputs. For offline use, export exactly the locked paths
and the unchanged lock into a directory and pass it here. The containing distribution can provide those files
from its checkout after verifying their locked bytes:
Replace `PAIRED_SERVER_COMMIT` with the exact server revision being evaluated.
Choose fresh, owned package-output and consumer directories for each attempt.

```sh
npm ci
npm run prepare:inputs
# Offline alternative: npm run prepare:inputs -- /path/to/canonical-export
npm test
npm run build
npm run test:artifact-assets
npm run package:artifact -- /tmp/client-package PAIRED_SERVER_COMMIT
(cd /tmp/client-package && npm pack --pack-destination /tmp)
```

Commit selected client changes before packaging. Build output is ignored `dist/`. A containing distribution can install the locked
Node dependencies in a parent directory; normal Node lookup resolves build tools,
vendor assets and licenses without a second installation. The zero-runtime-dependency archive contains `static/`, `index.mjs` exporting
`webDirectory`, and `component.json`. The record separates client source,
canonical input provenance, client version/build identity, asset hashes and the
exact declared server peer. Declaration is not compatibility qualification.

For browser checks, install Chromium in the owned environment with
`npx playwright install chromium`, or select an existing matching Playwright
browser cache. Install the archive in an empty consumer with scripts disabled,
then run the named fixture from this checkout:

```sh
npm install --prefix /tmp/client-consumer --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund /path/to/produced-client-archive.tgz
npm run test:artifact -- /tmp/client-consumer/node_modules/@amplifier/client-web PAIRED_SERVER_COMMIT
```

This fixture uses real HTTP/SSE and the installed browser assets with synthetic
state. It checks history, sending, rendered response, reconnect, retained draft
and no duplicate accepted send. Actual-server qualification remains with
[Unified's paired-server journey](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/816c7a67dbafc20bfb28723dd317c71d3bd2bb28/frontend/tests/client-paired-server-browser.mjs).

Canonical catalogs, SDK and branding are copied only into ignored `.build-inputs/`.
The committed lock is the trusted selection, not independent authentication of
its declared Git origin. Preparation rejects a different lock or changed,
missing, extra or nonregular files before replacing prior prepared inputs.
Generated inputs and output can be removed after their build/review purpose;
keep the small lock and artifact record. Server metadata such as `pyproject.toml`
is not a client build dependency and is excluded. The client package owns its
version; a server-only release does not require a new client version. Schema 1
exports remain valid for their own selected locks, including older 15-file sets;
this selection requires its exact 14-file set.

For connected development, `npm run dev` proxies API/WebSocket requests to an
owned actual server on port 8765. Released Unified installation and its Node-free
asset assembly are a separate distribution responsibility.

## Packaging an isolated source copy

### Temporary dual-repository maintenance

Unified ships the selected full tracked tree in `components/web-client/` with
`components/web-client.source.json`. Author or port client changes here first.
Then follow [Unified's refresh and retirement workflow](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/main/components/README.md#refresh-and-retire-the-copy):
export the whole tracked tree and source record from the exact reviewed, accepted
canonical commit, not unreviewed moving `main`. Never hand-edit the consumer copy
or generated assets. Verify tracked files and modes, source digest, build
provenance and the affected server pairing. Keep the selected shared-input lock.

Coordinate with the integration/release owner to preserve unrelated work and
avoid duplicate ports or reverting a later accepted selection. Carry both updates
or make an explicit named integration handoff with exact client and Unified
PRs/revisions and pending work. Canonical-only or copy-only changes are not
release-ready; a handoff does not waive synchronization. Report source acceptance,
copied selection, build/qualification and release as distinct states, using the
existing affected-check policy rather than a new full-suite requirement.

Retire this obligation only through an explicitly approved public/repository
delivery transition updating both repositories' guidance. Public availability
alone does not retire it or authorize changing this repository's visibility.

Create the small source record from a clean standalone client checkout:

```sh
node scripts/client-source.mjs record /tmp/web-client.source.json
```

Copy the selected client source without `.git`, dependencies or generated output.
In that copy, prepare inputs and build normally, then use the external record:

```sh
node scripts/client-source.mjs verify /path/to/web-client.source.json
npm run package:artifact -- /tmp/client-package PAIRED_SERVER_COMMIT --source-record /path/to/web-client.source.json
```

The record keeps the canonical client repository/revision and one digest covering
all selected authored packaging inputs, including these tools, the license and
shared-input lock. The distribution may add its delivery path/type; those fields
do not change client source identity. Normal packaging requires the client to be
its own Git root, so a containing Unified commit cannot be mislabeled as a client
commit. Package layout and consumer metadata are unchanged.

The copied `.gitattributes` keeps text checkouts at LF, including on Windows,
so source digests remain identical; binary files retain their original bytes.

The record is a trusted selection, not independent authentication if somebody
replaces both record and copied source. Edited copies can develop/build locally,
but cannot package as the previous canonical revision. Select the changed
canonical source and create a new record first. The distribution records its own
actual delivery commit separately; no self-referential containing commit is
embedded in this record.

## Shared interaction surface

App actions use `POST /api/actions`; `window.amplifier.getActions()` and
`window.amplifier.dispatch(name, args)` expose the same action surface. The
[live-session contract](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/816c7a67dbafc20bfb28723dd317c71d3bd2bb28/docs/clients/live-sessions.md) owns attachment,
explicit conversation targets, receipts, recovery and device effects. The
bundled client and server evolve together; independently released clients retain
their public contracts.

The [state stream adapter](src/state-stream.js) uses WebSocket events when the
attached host advertises support, with SSE for hosts that do not. Each stream
starts with a `state` snapshot and applies `state-delta` updates to its own
revision baseline. HTTP receipts and recovery reads do not replace that baseline.
Reconnect starts a fresh stream without replaying commands. See
[browser state transport](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/816c7a67dbafc20bfb28723dd317c71d3bd2bb28/docs/browser-state-transport.md) for bounded
projections, shell events and recovery behavior; measure construction work as
well as bytes under the [performance guidance](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/816c7a67dbafc20bfb28723dd317c71d3bd2bb28/docs/validation/performance.md).

`window.amplifier.getState()` exposes this browser's state, including private
input, plus a redacted rendered view. It is not the model-facing state projection.
The [browser observation code](src/api.js) excludes private inputs from automatic
`/api/view` reports and rendered-view inspection. Ordinary agent readback also
excludes unsent composer text, message edits and attachment drafts. User-requested
inspection uses the exact `/view/draft` or `/view/messageEdit` pointer and an
explicit `clientId` displaying the calling conversation; a broader read never
opts in. [The projection owner](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/816c7a67dbafc20bfb28723dd317c71d3bd2bb28/amplifier_web/agent_private_state.py) and
[CS2](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/816c7a67dbafc20bfb28723dd317c71d3bd2bb28/contracts/client-state.v1.md) define this boundary.

Privacy of model readback does not imply client-only storage. The current host
still stores acknowledged client drafts; the [draft journal](src/draft-journal.js)
keeps unacknowledged composer edits in browser session storage for recovery.
The [client vision](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/816c7a67dbafc20bfb28723dd317c71d3bd2bb28/docs/clients/VISION.md) describes the target local-only
persistence model, not a completed migration. Settings editors have their own
[draft and credential boundaries](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/816c7a67dbafc20bfb28723dd317c71d3bd2bb28/docs/SETTINGS.md#boundaries-and-state).

Browser effects (call media, notification permission, and file download) are delivered in `deviceCommands`, with command IDs deduplicated against HTTP responses. Existing effects are not replayed when opening the app. Microphone and notification grants remain browser permission prompts.

## Themes

`src/reference.css` is the shared neutral appearance foundation. Gallery appearances contribute validated palette, typography and artwork deltas rather than replacing that foundation. The build always links a real CSS file in HTML; theme application does not depend on enabling a disabled stylesheet or on `@scope` support. The same foundation is copied to `dist/reference.amplifier.css` for reset and export.

The stable root is `#amp-one`, with named `data-part` surfaces. A skin can replace
variables or component styles. See [themes](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/816c7a67dbafc20bfb28723dd317c71d3bd2bb28/docs/shell/themes.md) for surface
names, library/editor operations, preview versus Apply, and portable CSS validation.
Applied skins are validated by the Python service; use embedded data assets rather
than remote URLs.

## Validation

`npm test` runs the client unit suite. `npm run test:portable` is an alias for
that same suite, not a separate partial owner. `npm run test:updates` and
`npm run test:navigation` select focused client units. After building,
`npm run test:artifact-assets` checks the produced assets.

The named browser commands and `tests/browser-checks.json` own client-only
journeys against synthetic HTTP/SSE peers. `npm run test:artifact` checks the
installed archive. These are separate scopes from unit tests and actual-server
acceptance; a passing synthetic fixture does not establish live-provider or
paired-release behavior. Prepare shared inputs and matching browser dependencies
before the affected checks. Preserve assertions and report failures and skips.

Test ownership is classified: client behavior and its synthetic peers live here;
Unified owns host/browser integration, canonical-input production, release and
examples in `tests/web` and `scripts/`. Shared generic helper APIs use one
canonical implementation with injected test-framework facades. Unified's normal
browser runner composes the two registries and records each identity; copying
client tests back into the host would create a second owner.

The following pinned links retain the earlier owner locations as historical
references. For the current layout and commands, use Unified's
[component ownership guide](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/main/components/README.md).

Application builds and browser acceptance follow the owning workspace's DTU
rules. Record exact sources and limits. Unified owns its release/adoption;
this private component does not automatically replace its tested default.

The [build identity owner](scripts/build-identity.mjs) includes authored browser,
public, branding and prepared canonical inputs so a same-version rebuild can offer
reload. Declare actual new build dependencies there. Generated copies are excluded;
the locked dependencies and normal build environment are assumed. This source ID
does not replace release qualification's full-tree, toolchain and exact-asset proof.
