# Host protocol — v1 (RATIFIED 2026-10-02)

Clause prefix: **HP**. Parent: [family vision](../docs/architecture/VISION.md).
Governs the generic host and its AHP consumers; upstream owns the wire semantics.

## Who builds against this

Host implementers, web/TUI/independent client builders, capability authors and reviewers.

## What it is

A durable host represents authorized agent work through AHP. Its catalog and
resource subscriptions do not require consumers to import the host implementation.

```text
client -- AHP initialize / listSessions / subscribe / actions --> host
host -- negotiated snapshots, action envelopes, notifications --> client
host -- ACP --> session's chosen agent
```

The [protocol design](../docs/architecture/protocol-fit.md) cites upstream authority;
[CS](client-state.v1.md) owns client intent, configuration and device effects.

## The promises

1. **HP1 — Adopt the upstream protocol.** Negotiate supported AHP versions and use
   their schemas, actions and reducers. Upstream rules take priority over local
   design notes; optional namespaced extensions never redefine a standard action.
   Broken: a stock peer needs a private reducer to read ordinary chat. Affected: all clients.

2. **HP2 — Separate resources and catalogs.** Publish AHP state by resource and
   interest. List sessions through the standard paged catalog; load conversation
   details only when required. [WS](working-set.v1.md) owns filtering and work bounds.
   Broken: a root subscription contains every saved transcript. Affected: large installations.

3. **HP3 — Recover through upstream semantics.** Sequence, echo, rejection, replay
   and snapshot recovery follow the negotiated AHP version. A missing confirmed
   baseline requires fresh state; notification-only catalogs are refetched as specified.
   Broken: a delta is applied to an absent base or reconnect repeats intent. Affected: reconnecting clients.

4. **HP4 — Preserve independent lifetimes.** The host owns agent connections and
   accepted work beyond any viewer connection. Multiple authorized views share that
   authority. Resource subscriptions alone never grant execution or filesystem permission.
   Broken: closing a tab cancels work or bypasses approval. Affected: unattended work and other viewers.

5. **HP5 — Make capability limits visible.** Map agent capabilities to honest host
   operations. Unsupported queue, steer, takeover or device behavior is unavailable,
   never silently translated into a different action. [AP](agent-protocol.v1.md) owns agent mappings.
   Resource scope and originating execution identity are distinct: a host-scoped
   operation can retain its authenticated calling agent's conversation. The host
   obtains that origin from its trusted execution binding, never action arguments
   or a client claim. Topic scope is checked before admission; narrowing a new-command
   bound does not discard passive access to an existing durable receipt.
   Broken: a baseline cancel claims live steering or force termination. Affected: operators.

6. **HP6 — Keep admission independently recoverable.** Persist host command identity
   and admission outcome before dispatching accepted execution. Reconcile unknown
   outcomes without automatic resubmission. AHP echo is not proof of completed effects.
   Broken: retry after a lost response starts another turn. Affected: people with unstable connections.

## Not in v1

Cross-host execution migration or cross-engine continuation; promote only with separate
ownership and recovery contracts. No private replacement for AHP's reconciliation rules.

## How the kit checks it

- HP1/HP5: run standard peers and schema fixtures, including absent extension support.
- HP5: deny wrong topic scopes and forged origin claims; allow a bound agent's
  host-scoped own-session operation; inspect legacy command receipts after restart.
- HP2: trace catalog/detail reads using WS's large-history fixture.
- HP3: drop/reorder connections, expire replay and remove the client baseline.
- HP4: disconnect every viewer during work; deny an unauthorized operation.
- HP6: kill around admission/dispatch and lose replies; count accepted turns and effects.

Qualification is tracked by exact implementation in
[the status ledger](../docs/architecture/implementation-status.md).
[The plan](../docs/architecture/delivery-plan.md) records the remaining delivery gates.

## Open questions

Which supported AHP SDK/runtime combination best serves the extracted host?
Which command receipts can be recovered with upstream identities alone before any extension?
