# Source assessment and evidence boundaries

Reviewed 2026-10-02. This is source research and a recorded synthetic probe, not a
production trace or proof that the proposed architecture is implemented.

## Unified baseline

Source: [Unified e9a3a2fa / v0.20.45](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/tree/e9a3a2fa9a6f2291e451fb95a0202b0a0b9156e6).
The docs branch starts from that revision. Source and fixtures were inspected;
Spark-1/Spark-2 were not modified or measured for this packet.

During document preparation, main advanced to
[828d2bff](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/commit/828d2bff97a77fbdbd0f06429369f7ff1f4abf42)
for tool-error/conversation-outcome presentation. The changed-file comparison did
not change the save/publication, agent-query, retention or discovery files below.
The recorded timings remain the earlier exact source, not a rerun of that commit.

| Finding | Source at the reviewed revision | Implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scoped save/publication already exists; unknown/global paths still choose broad save and projection work | [`service.py`](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/e9a3a2fa9a6f2291e451fb95a0202b0a0b9156e6/amplifier_web/service.py#L656), `_save` and `_publish` | Preserve proven narrow paths; protocol replacement alone will not remove broad fallbacks |
| Narrow durable records overlay a broader checkpoint | [`state_records.py`](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/e9a3a2fa9a6f2291e451fb95a0202b0a0b9156e6/amplifier_web/state_records.py) | Scoped durable entities must become the normal unit rather than exceptions around a global object |
| Browser projections and delta transport are present | [`state_projections.py`](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/e9a3a2fa9a6f2291e451fb95a0202b0a0b9156e6/amplifier_web/state_projections.py), [`state_transport.py`](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/e9a3a2fa9a6f2291e451fb95a0202b0a0b9156e6/amplifier_web/state_transport.py) | Small wire payloads do not prove small projection/diff cost; shell keys still traverse broad catalog facts |
| Agent state query constructs a state context before extracting a requested pointer | [`agent_canvas.py:92`](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/e9a3a2fa9a6f2291e451fb95a0202b0a0b9156e6/amplifier_web/agent_canvas.py#L92), [`agent_state.py`](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/e9a3a2fa9a6f2291e451fb95a0202b0a0b9156e6/amplifier_web/agent_state.py) | Even a scalar response can incur broad work; replace with direct scoped reads |
| Private client views/drafts remain backend-managed | [`client_views.py`](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/e9a3a2fa9a6f2291e451fb95a0202b0a0b9156e6/amplifier_web/client_views.py) | Move ordinary private persistence to clients, retaining explicit shared/agent-visible capabilities |
| Runtime retention exists: defaults include 32 warm workers, 12-hour idle threshold and prewarm on selection | [`runtime_retention.py`](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/e9a3a2fa9a6f2291e451fb95a0202b0a0b9156e6/amplifier_web/runtime_retention.py#L8) | Reconsider what deserves runtime residency; count limits alone do not bound bytes |
| Display cooling and automatic history/watch mechanisms exist | [`cold_display.py`](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/e9a3a2fa9a6f2291e451fb95a0202b0a0b9156e6/amplifier_web/cold_display.py), [`automatic_history.py`](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/e9a3a2fa9a6f2291e451fb95a0202b0a0b9156e6/amplifier_web/automatic_history.py), [`history_watch.py`](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-unified/blob/e9a3a2fa9a6f2291e451fb95a0202b0a0b9156e6/amplifier_web/history_watch.py) | Extend existing useful work into indexed discovery and separately budgeted history views |

## Synthetic cost-shape probe

Recorded [measurements](evidence/measurements.json) and
[probe source](evidence/baseline-probe.py). Real AppService/projection/persistence
code, synthetic catalog and tiny message bodies, no model calls. Three sequential
samples per operation; table shows medians in milliseconds. No HTTP/SSE encoding,
browser painting, production filesystem, active-model contention or RSS measurement.

| Stored chats / attached clients | Scoped detail publication | Global publication | Private draft action | Agent scalar `/revision` read |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 100 / 1 | 12.33 | 6.16 | 3.96 | 1.13 |
| 5,000 / 1 | 7.97 | 30.78 | 34.22 | 34.41 |
| 22,500 / 1 | 12.46 | 137.51 | 156.68 | 214.91 |
| 22,500 / 8 | 10.77 | 161.36 | 182.28 | 225.57 |

This supports the hypothesis that unrelated historical scale still affects some
small operations; it does **not** identify the full cause of multi-second UI
latency. The fixture varies workspace count as well as session count, so it does
not isolate their separate effects. The delivery plan requires an end-to-end
trace and independent count variation before claiming a performance improvement.

The probe used current source with an existing `release-02031-charlie` dependency
environment, not a freshly resolved v0.20.45 environment. An initial environment
attempt lacked `amplifier_foundation.settings`; those failed-start attempts are
not measurements. Rerun using the exact source, its test fixtures and a compatible
dependency environment; record a new result rather than overwriting this receipt.
The script is an investigation artifact, not an added production regression test.

## Refreshed source context

[The manifest](evidence/upstream-revisions.json) records full revisions for the
Converge umbrella and related repos, protocols, native runtime libraries, TUI/CLI,
daemon and adapter sources. Source snapshots were refreshed as read-only reference;
none were installed or treated as proof of running behavior.

The current [Converge checkpoint](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-converge/blob/c63f1e6bea6d93e5ffb86b0e3dbcc698391cbe9c/docs/workflow/UNIFIED-CHECKPOINT-20260923.md)
keeps Method, portable operating guidance, optional Unified integration, domain
capabilities and native execution as separate owners. It explicitly does not
establish Codex/Claude/Copilot compatibility. This design carries that distinction
forward and uses bounded lane briefs, public seam tests and independent checking.
No changes were made to Converge's own ratified/locked documents.

The refreshed `amplifier-agent` contracts differ materially from its description
in the ecosystem module catalog: it now has embedding APIs and a frozen engine
contract, including a one-provider constraint. Use the repository's actual
contract for evaluation, not the catalog's older per-turn-subprocess description.
The TUI is already a separate repository and its connected mode has local state
and an HTTP backend; extraction work should evolve that seam rather than start over.

Before changing an Amplifier module class, the implementation lane must inventory
**every known affected implementation**: current `docs/MODULES.md`, configured,
local, embedded and community sources, exact revisions, unaffected cases and
coverage gaps. This packet is an architecture assessment, not a claim that a
class-wide implementation audit or full runtime parity qualification is complete.

## What remains unverified

Actual AHP/ACP peer interoperability, legacy native resume through the new adapter,
end-to-end latency, memory budgets, feature parity, physical-device behavior,
real-account authentication/model calls, released components and deployed worker
adoption. Those are explicit delivery gates, not conclusions of this document.
