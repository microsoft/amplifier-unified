# Protocol fit, capabilities and interoperability

Design supporting [HP](../../contracts/host-protocol.v1.md) and
[AP](../../contracts/agent-protocol.v1.md). Sources were refreshed on 2026-10-02;
exact inspected commits are recorded in [evidence](evidence.md). These are
source/documentation findings, not live interoperability results.

## Prefer upstream semantics

The [AHP/ACP guide](https://microsoft.github.io/agent-host-protocol/guide/ahp-and-acp.html)
describes complementary roles: a durable host mediates clients using AHP and can
reach agents using ACP. Follow the owning specification when guide examples or
our design notes differ. Do not copy the standard into an Amplifier wire document.

At the reviewed revisions, AHP's current protocol version is `0.9.0` and ACP's
stable wire protocol is `1`. ACP's v2 directory is not evidence that v2 is stable.
Package versions and schema releases are distinct from negotiated wire versions.
Qualification records must name SDK/schema, host, agent, client and capabilities.
Track upstream releases through compatibility tests; inspection SHAs are receipts,
not standing deployment pins. Recheck versions before implementation and release.

Use AHP's root/session/chat/resource surfaces, upstream reducers, subscriptions,
reconciliation and supported transport. Prefer the official TS/Rust tooling when
it fits the extracted components. Evaluate host language/runtime with a small
conformance spike; a protocol decision does not require rewriting the Python
agent runtime. ACP stdio is the initial process boundary. Do not assume proposed
remote transports or a vendor's TCP mode are a portable multi-client solution.

## Wrap the native application runtime

Yes: ACP can be the **sole normal host-to-agent execution interface**. Wrap the
runtime layer that prepares bundles and owns sessions, hooks, persistence,
approvals, cancellation and native ownership. Merely translating
`AmplifierSession.execute(str) -> str` misses streamed tools, questions, images,
runtime controls and lifecycle. Keep the kernel and modules protocol-independent.

The generic host starts/configures an agent process, negotiates ACP, admits work,
maps updates to AHP and holds the ACP connection independently of UI lifetime.
The adapter translates native events incrementally rather than exporting the
entire native context. Persist native-ID mappings and ownership with a clear
crash-recovery rule; a process pool is an optional optimization after isolation
tests, not one process per historical session.

**Do not equate two existing products.** The freshly reviewed `amplifier-agent`
repository now offers Python/TypeScript embedding APIs and a frozen engine contract.
That contract constrains one provider per agent and its own configuration surface.
It is not established as a drop-in replacement for today's bundle/module runtime.
Build `amplifier-agent-acp` over the runtime we already use. The user explicitly
excluded `microsoft/amplifier-agent` from the migration; do not adopt it as the backend.

## Mapping inventory

This assigns a destination, not a promise that every mapping already exists.
The agent lane must expand it to the complete affected module/control inventory.

| Current behavior | Preferred boundary | Constraint / evidence required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initialize, authenticate, new session, prompt, streaming output/tool progress | Standard ACP; translated to standard AHP chat lifecycle | Preserve negotiated content types, failures and permissions |
| Native load/resume | Standard optional ACP capabilities | `session/load` replays visible history; `session/resume` avoids replay when supported; do not invoke load just to list/view |
| Turn cancellation | Standard ACP `session/cancel` | Cancellation is not rollback, force process death or live steering |
| Session close/worker retirement | Optional ACP close plus native safe-lifecycle policy | Close may cancel/free resources; never equate it with a client unsubscribe |
| Modes, model and simple supported session choices | ACP `configOptions`, with legacy modes when required | Standard response/update contains the complete config-options list, not a private partial patch |
| Permissions and agent questions | Standard ACP permission/content surfaces where faithful; AHP input surface | Arbitrary rich forms may need extensions; one accepted answer across viewers |
| Filesystem and terminal callbacks | Host as ACP client, scoped to execution workspace | Never route authority implicitly to whichever browser last sent input |
| Native parent/child activity | Standard tool reporting baseline; negotiated subagent/session extensions when available | Do not assume draft subagent proposals are universally implemented; child histories load on demand |
| Queue, live steer, goals/budgets, autonomous continuation | AHP controls backed by a faithful ACP capability/extension | Do not silently emulate steer by cancel-and-reprompt or infer goals from plain prompts |
| `operations.submit/cancel/write`, force stop and takeover | Standard lifecycle where exact; adapter/runtime control extension otherwise | Inventory cancellation/ownership fences and agent-process failure separately |
| `native.status/compact`, `context.clear`, `memory.consolidate`, `goals.*`, `budget.*` | Native agent control extension or supported standard command | Preserve user/agent action parity; declare unsupported peers |
| `provider.select`, `mode.*` | Standard session config when representable | Complete option state and clear apply point; advanced routing stays composition config |
| `provider.reset`, `tool.invoke`, native diagnostics | Scoped native control/admin capability | No generic host dependence on Amplifier internal method names |
| `configuration.inspect/apply/toggle/exportResources` | Host/agent configuration administration with standard session selectors where suitable | Persisted/effective/mounted distinction; bundle/module composition remains modular |
| `configuration.providers/providerModels/providerTest/providerLogin`, `catalog.inspect`, `usage.inspect` | Dedicated catalog/auth/config/read capabilities, selected standard fields where available | Listing never silently probes, logs in or mounts every provider |
| `history.snapshot`, native transcript/export | Native store reader behind adapter/resource interface | Viewing must not prepare execution or trigger ACP full-history load unnecessarily |
| Artifacts, diffs, resources, terminal output | Standard ACP content/tool data and AHP resources/changesets where expressible | Stable references, capability fallback, on-demand large bodies |
| Canvas/MCP Apps, device actions, rich editors | Optional host capabilities and client renderers | Explicit audience/permissions; generic textual/artifact fallback |
| Realtime voice/video | Separate media transport with protocol-visible lifecycle/control | ACP audio content is not a full-duplex WebRTC contract |
| Schedules, background operations, Converge workflows | Host/capability owners, standard AHP surfaces when qualified | No Converge domain model in generic host; automation maturity checked separately |
| Agent inspection/actions in the application | Scoped public host actions via an MCP/tool facade | Same authoritative operation as UI; no hidden whole-app snapshot or Python callback graph |

Use upstream [ACP configuration](https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/v1/session-config-options)
before adding a settings extension. ACP v1 `session/prompt` completes with the
turn's outcome; an early host admission receipt is a separate fact. Do not import
v2 prompt lifecycle semantics into a v1 connection.

Every candidate extension needs a named owner, version/capability negotiation,
permission scope, producer, consumers, rejection behavior, ordinary fallback and
conformance fixture. Use ACP's `_` methods and namespaced `_meta`, and AHP's `x-`
extension conventions as specified. Prefer an existing upstream capability when
it graduates; don't require another product's opt-in extension for baseline ACP.
Extensions may carry advanced control without restoring a second generic native
execution API. Administration configures an adapter; it does not run turns around ACP.

## Important performance limits of the standards

AHP has paged `listSessions`; its root state does not contain the session catalog.
Catalog notifications are ephemeral and must be reconciled after reconnect.
Its optional shared draft need not receive every keystroke. Those choices support
the proposed local-state and bounded-discovery design directly.

There are limits to honor. AHP `view.turns` is advisory, omitting it requests all
retained turns, and `fetchTurns` grows reduced state. ACP `session/load` replays
visible history when supported; resume without replay is an optional capability.
We cannot promise strict bounded memory for arbitrary peer behavior without
testing these paths and settling any retention/extension gaps. See
[state design](state-and-storage.md) for the safeguards and open boundary.

Neither protocol guarantees exactly-once external tool effects. The host keeps
durable admission receipts; downstream uncertainty remains unknown unless native
identity/history proves the result. Never resend prompts merely because a socket
closed. Host event replay must only restore a view, not repeat execution.

## Existing external implementations to qualify

| Candidate | Confirmed source/documentation | Proposed test; current result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub Copilot CLI agent | [Native ACP server](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-cli-reference/acp-server), `copilot --acp --stdio`, public preview | Run through our host; config, permissions, cancel, resume and two AHP viewers. Runtime untested. |
| OpenAI Codex agent | [`agentclientprotocol/codex-acp`](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/codex-acp), new adapter over Codex App Server; old Zed repo points here | Reuse adapter; validate native auth, tools, cancellation, history, negotiated extras. Runtime untested. |
| Anthropic agent | [`agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp`](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp), adapter using Claude Agent SDK | Reuse adapter; validate approvals, tools, history, child fallback. Runtime untested. |
| Independent ACP client | [Zed external agents](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/external-agents) and [ACP clients directory](https://agentclientprotocol.com/get-started/clients) | Run our Amplifier ACP agent without Unified; basic and optional capability behavior. Runtime untested. |
| Independent AHP peers | [AHP implementations](https://microsoft.github.io/agent-host-protocol/guide/implementations.html), including reference SDKs and community clients/hosts | Choose a runnable client against our host and host against our client at declared versions. Runtime untested. |
| Additional engines | Choose a distinct implementation such as Gemini CLI or an ACP reference fixture after source review | Adds diversity after first three; not yet source-qualified in this packet. |

The current Codex adapter is now `@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp`; do not build on
the superseded Zed adapter based on an old README. Its current source advertises
standard features plus opt-in AIR extensions. Claude's adapter likewise has
optional extensions. These are useful compatibility evidence to examine, not
automatic requirements for Amplifier or proof of upstream standardization.

Distinguish **agent/harness integration** from **vendor client integration**.
These findings do not show that stock Codex desktop, Claude Code's own interface
or every Copilot UI can attach to an arbitrary AHP host. Claim compatibility only
for the actual executable, version, direction and feature set tested. No accounts
were authenticated and no paid model calls were run for this design packet.

An ACP-only editor has two possible paths: use our ACP agent directly for standalone
work, or use a future **ACP-facing bridge that acts as an AHP client** to our host.
The latter can preserve the host's multi-client ownership without requiring the
editor to implement AHP. Evaluate existing bridges first. Qualify session identity,
load replay, concurrent approvals and capability loss before promising it; the
bridge must not own a second history or execution runtime. This is a follow-on
compatibility lane, separate from the core host-to-agent ACP adapter.

## What we give up and gain

| Tradeoff | Consequence |
| --- | --- |
| No direct host access to live Amplifier objects | Explicit async control/events and serialization; simpler isolation, mocking and independent replacement |
| No assumption every peer has all Amplifier features | Advanced controls become negotiated; baseline clients remain useful and honest |
| Engine-bound sessions | No transparent mid-session engine swap; simpler native history and ownership, new sessions can choose freely |
| Local drafts by default | No implicit cross-device private-draft recovery; zero routine sync cost and independent editors |
| Cold histories and idle agents | First history page or execution start may incur latency; bounded steady-state memory and predictable navigation |
| More repositories and version combinations | More release/CI integration work; smaller ownership surfaces and parallel development against fixtures |
| Upstream-driven wire evolution | Ongoing adapter qualification and occasional extension work; community peers can challenge our assumptions |

The recommended compromise is ACP for all normal execution, with optional
protocol extensions and scoped administration for Amplifier's differentiators.
Reducing Amplifier to the smallest intersection of all peers is unnecessary.
