# Unified live session contract, version 1

TUI implementers: start with the [integration handoff](tui-handoff.md) for the
supported release, client lifecycle, retry rules and acceptance checklist.

Unified owns execution while holding the Foundation session lock. Web, terminal,
and native clients attach to that host. Attaching or disconnecting a client never
acquires, releases, stops, or transfers execution ownership. Existing CLI takeover
remains an explicit, separate operation.

## Shared work and independent presentation

Accepted input, replies, streaming text, tool/worker progress, approvals, session
configuration, and ownership status belong to the session. All attached clients
observe those changes. An approval can be answered once; a competing answer gets
a conflict and must refresh.

Each client owns its selection, per-conversation draft and pending attachments,
panels, layout, canvas selection/tabs/controls, modular-shell composition, and
device effects. A clipboard or permission request goes to its initiating client.
Accepted attachments and published artifacts become shared session content.

The browser creates a fresh client ID for each page load. It restores a copy of
the prior page's presentation using `resumeClientId`; duplicate tabs therefore
start with the same view but diverge independently. Saved client drafts are
retained in the app database, including when no stream is connected. Client IDs
are presentation identities, not credentials or security boundaries.

## Authentication and attachment

Use the host's existing authenticated browser cookie or control bearer token.
All endpoints retain existing Host, Origin, and authentication checks. Native
clients should verify TLS with the host's trusted certificate.

1. `POST /api/clients/attach` with
   `{"clientId":"unique-client-id","kind":"tui","protocolVersion":1}`.
   Optional `resumeClientId` copies a prior client's view. Supported kinds:
   `web`, `tui`, `native`, `api`.
2. Send `X-Amplifier-Client: unique-client-id` on subsequent API requests.
   Native browser EventSource and iframe URLs can use `?clientId=...`.
   Conflicting header/query identities are rejected.
3. Attachment returns `protocolVersion`, `hostInstanceId`, supported transports,
   reconnect behavior (`snapshot`), and initial browser state.

Reusing an existing client ID intentionally reconnects to that same presentation.
Use a different ID for each concurrently independent client.

## Session operations

| Endpoint | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/sessions?offset=0&limit=100` | Bounded summaries, optional `workspace` path, and `nextOffset`. |
| `GET /api/sessions/{id}` | Full current session snapshot without changing selection. |
| `POST /api/sessions/{id}/commands` | Explicit session target and stable command ID. |
| `GET /api/sessions/{id}/events` | SSE `snapshot` events containing the complete current session. |
| `POST /api/actions` | Existing app operations, including creation and client-local presentation. |
| `GET /api/actions` | Discover current action names and schemas. |

Example command body:
```json
{
  "id": "persist-this-id-before-sending",
  "action": "conversation.send",
  "args": {"text": "Continue the work"}
}
```

Session commands include send/stop, worker spawn/stop/steer, approval responses,
runtime controls, background preparation, history loading, rename, and takeover. A session argument that
conflicts with the URL is rejected. The SPA uses the same service dispatch through
`/api/actions`; session operations capture their target before awaiting history or
runtime admission.

Keep the same command ID and arguments after an uncertain transport failure.
Persisted receipts deduplicate retries by client, action, arguments, and origin.
A changed command with the same ID is rejected. Command acceptance is distinct
from a completed model/tool operation. Interrupted or uncertain work is never
automatically rerun by attachment, reload, or SSE reconnection.

The optional `expectedRevision` checks the app's global state revision, including
presentation changes; it is not a per-session revision. Do not use it as a
mandatory send precondition during active streaming.

### Optional preparation on navigation

After discovering `session.warm` in `GET /api/actions`, a client can issue it
through the session command endpoint with empty arguments. It schedules
background preparation under the host's policy without submitting input or
changing the client's selection. Acceptance means scheduled, not ready.
`session.preparation.status` exposes `preparing`, `ready`, `warm`, `active`,
`cold`, or `unavailable` when known. The web's `session.select` schedules the
same preparation automatically; a TUI that keeps navigation local can call
`session.warm` immediately when a conversation is selected.

Reading a session or opening its event stream does not itself warm it. Warmth
is advisory: a worker can retire or another host can acquire ownership before
the next command. Send through the normal command API regardless of warmth.
Preparation never requests takeover, submits input, or replays earlier work.
The host defaults to 32 idle workers for 12 hours, with two simultaneous
background starts. Idle workers release the Foundation writer lock. Client
disconnect does not stop active work or reset the idle-retention clock.

## Reconnect and lifetime

An SSE ID is `<hostInstanceId>:<revision>`. Every connection starts with a complete
current snapshot, including partial assistant text. Replace the prior projection;
do not append the snapshot as new messages. A host restart changes
`hostInstanceId`, so clients must accept its new revision range.

Version 1 does **not** promise replay of every intermediate event or honor
`Last-Event-ID` as an incremental cursor. Slow subscribers may receive coalesced
snapshots. Heartbeats run every 20 seconds. Session deletion emits a final
`deleted: true` snapshot. Reconnect uses the same attached client identity and
does not resubmit commands or replay device effects.

The browser stream remains `/api/events`, with independent client snapshots and
the shell's `shell` invalidations. Dedicated session streams contain session
snapshots only. An admitted command continues if its HTTP connection disappears.

## Terminal adapter

`amplifier_web.session_client.SessionClient` implements authenticated attachment,
session listing/creation, explicit commands, and reconnecting SSE snapshots using
aiohttp. It never imports an execution runtime or acquires a Foundation lock.

```python
from amplifier_web.session_client import SessionClient

async def send_and_follow(url, token, session_id, command_id):
    # Retain these IDs for retries; use a new client ID for an independent window.
    async with SessionClient(url, token, "my-terminal") as client:
        await client.command(
            session_id, "conversation.send", {"text": "Hello from the terminal"},
            command_id=command_id,
        )
        async for snapshot in client.snapshots(session_id):
            render_session(snapshot["session"])  # replace the displayed projection
```

A TUI integration supplies this adapter behind its runtime interface, translates
snapshots into its own widgets, and keeps navigation/drafts local to that client.
Its disconnect/exit action closes the adapter; stop/cancel invokes an explicit
session command. This change provides the shared contract and tested adapter.
It does not modify a separately hosted amplifier-app-tui repository.

## Storage and scope

Conversation persistence and existing CLI history discovery remain in place.
Client presentation is separately rebuildable app data. This change does not
implement event-log-only runtime recovery, compaction replay, log pruning,
execution migration to another machine, or multi-device voice-call arbitration.
Those require their own contracts; Foundation ownership stays configurable.

### Drafts before a conversation exists

An attached client may save its empty-composer draft with
`view.update {sessionId: null, patch: {draft: "..."}}`. The explicit null target
means its private pre-conversation draft, even if selection changes before the
request arrives. This does not create a conversation or start work. The draft
survives reload and host restart; creating the first conversation carries it
forward. A string targets that conversation; omitting the target uses the
client's current selection. Other session commands still require string IDs
when a target is supplied.


## Stream display identity and shared names

This additive v1 extension supplies `session.streamingId` with `session.streaming`.
The corresponding final assistant message carries the same `streamId`; replace
that partial display item instead of appending a second copy. These are display
identities, not command/input provenance. Never infer an input ID from the most
recent user message. Older compatible hosts may omit them; clients can show a
receiving indicator until the identified final message arrives.

Stop, error, yield and host recovery settle interrupted partial text as explicitly
labelled partial display evidence and clear the active identity. Historical editing
clears it too. A subsequent response receives a new identity. Settling display
text does not claim model completion or replay any tool action.

Automatic naming runs on the execution host through its configured ecosystem hook.
The host controls scheduling while the hook supplies context sampling, prompting,
model routing and parsing. `session.rename` is an explicit manual choice stored
through Foundation's shared metadata API. Custom names, including legacy names
with unspecified source, skip automated renaming; compare-and-set storage also
protects against an already-running naming call completing after a manual rename.
Clients display the resulting shared title instead of running their own naming model.
