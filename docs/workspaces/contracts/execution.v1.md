# Workspace Execution Contract — v1 (ACCEPTED DIRECTION)

How chats use their chosen folders and coordinate concurrent file changes.

## Who builds against this

The execution/worktree service allocates working areas and writer ownership.
The runtime, helpers, editor adapters, and developers consume those bindings.
Existing Foundation ownership and Unified handoff receipts remain authoritative.

## What it is

A change set groups one piece of ongoing work across repository checkouts or
document drafts. Its execution binding carries a revision and one writer owner.
An isolated working directory is not a security sandbox.

```json
{"changeSetId":"change1","sessionId":"native-session-1","mode":"workspace-folder",
 "bindings":[{"repositoryId":"repo1","baseCommit":"abc123","checkoutId":"co1"}],
 "writer":{"ownerId":"worker1","generation":7},"executionRevision":4}
{"helperId":"helper1","parentId":"native-session-1","access":"read-snapshot",
 "snapshotId":"snapshot1","scratchId":"scratch1"}
```

## The promises

1. **Reading does not allocate writers.** Discussion and inspection use identified
   source snapshots and separate scratch space. A chat does not create branches
   merely by opening, and a reviewer cannot alter its reviewed source binding.

2. **Chosen folders are real working folders.** Ordinary chat edits use the
   selected workspace folder. A terminal or editor there sees the same files.
   Attachment cannot silently substitute a hidden working copy for the user's folder.

3. **One checkout has one writer.** Owner generations fence managed writes.
   Old processes must be quiesced or reconciled before reassignment. Stale writes
   must be refused for the new owner's safety. External editors remain observable
   participants; the service does not pretend to lock out unmanaged tools.

4. **Helpers inherit a bounded assignment.** A helper has a real parent, scope,
   result destination, and read/write mode. It cannot use workspace membership
   to command unrelated chats or update their preview targets.

5. **Concurrency choices belong to tasks.** Conflicting writes to one folder
   queue by default. Authorized independent parallel work can use separate copies,
   with the task path visible and a terminal opening there. Folder attachment
   never asks the user to choose an execution mode or silently relocates a chat.

6. **Bindings govern the whole runtime.** Shell cwd, file tools, dependency
   loading, tests, and supported preview launchers use the same recorded change
   set. Falling back to another task's mutable checkout fails the developer's check.

7. **Document work preserves the original.** For non-Git files, changes use owned
   drafts and an explicit destination/version check. An unsupported writer tool
   cannot silently overwrite a shared source while reporting isolated execution.

## Not in v1

- **Hard isolation from arbitrary shell programs** is promoted through a real
  filesystem/container enforcement backend. Path bindings alone do not prove it.
- **Automatic background relocation** requires an explicit task-level experience
  and authorization; file-ownership hints do not override the single-writer default.

## How the kit checks it

- P1: inspect a repository and assert no branch, checkout, or source mutation.
- P2: edit through a workspace chat and read the same file from its terminal/editor.
- P3: restart, expire a writer, and attempt writes using the old generation.
- P4: attempt a peer mutation from a helper and require a scope refusal.
- P5: race two writers; verify queuing, then authorize separate work and inspect cwd.
- P6: inspect shell, imports, tests, and preview provenance in a two-repo fixture.
- P7: race an original document update against accepting a generated draft.

## Open questions

- Which first-release tool adapters can enforce isolated non-Git document writes,
  and which must report an unsupported operation instead of implying protection?

## Changelog

| Date | Change | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-22 | Initial execution contract. | Successful shared-clone/worktree workflow and observed shared-environment limitations. |
| 2026-09-22 | Folder-first execution; task-level concurrency only. | User rejected attachment-time developer modes and required terminal-visible edits. |

Design direction accepted by the user on 2026-09-22. Acceptance is not a claim of implementation conformance; see [implementation status](../IMPLEMENTATION.md).
