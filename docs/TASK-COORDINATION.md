# Task and worker coordination

The **Tasks and workers** panel under Session details uses the same actions as
the agent app bridge. It watches explicit targets, sends follow-ups, and requests
interruption without selecting a different conversation or changing its composer
draft. There is no new scheduler, worker registry, or implicit delegation of
top-level conversations.

## Shared actions

- `coordination.list {sessionId?, limit?}` returns up to 100 conversation and
  worker summaries. A known conversation can be listed directly. Native saved
  child conversations remain in the existing subagent history view.
- `coordination.wait {targets, waitMs?, maxBytes?}` accepts 1–8 distinct targets.
  A target is `{sessionId, workerId?, afterCursor?}`. Without a cursor it returns
  the current snapshot. With cursors it waits for the first new report, completed
  turn, interruption, failure, pending question, or permission request, up to
  60 seconds. Tool/retry progress does not repeatedly wake it. `waitMs: 0` reads
  immediately. Missing targets return per-target errors.
- `coordination.followup {sessionId, workerId?, text}` uses the ordinary
  `conversation.send` path with draft preservation or `worker.message`, which
  submits an input to that exact live persistent child. A finite or retired
  child cannot silently be recreated. Use a stable action command ID for retries.
- `coordination.interrupt {sessionId, workerId?}` uses the existing conversation
  or worker stop path. It reports a request, never rollback or proof that all
  nested effects stopped.

Read actions neither start runtimes nor select conversations. They do not hold
the host command lock while waiting. Browser waits have their own independent
request path, so sending, navigation and stop controls remain available.

The authenticated app bridge supplies the calling conversation identity. Agent
mutations through these new actions and `worker.message` are confined to that
conversation and its actual workers. Cross-conversation writes require an
explicit UI/user action. There is no model-supplied authorization flag. This
does not redesign the authority of older unrelated app actions.

## Delivery and recovery

Conversation results refer to their existing saved message IDs. Child results
carry a stable child session ID, real parent session ID, a fresh run ID, and a
new report ID for each report. Completing an idle persistent child does not
publish its last report a second time. An idle child is available for follow-up;
it is not evidence that its entire responsibility or saved task is complete.
Saved task IDs and worker operation IDs are separate references, not aliases for
conversation or run identity.

The existing worker record retains 32 report receipts with at most 20,000
characters each. These live beside its lifecycle state in the existing session
view file. They are omitted from ordinary browser progress snapshots. Existing
operation adapters continue projecting the authoritative worker row; no worker
lifecycle is duplicated in another operation journal.

Each wait target returns `nextCursor`, `results`, `cursorGap`, and `hasMore`.
Consume/deduplicate results by ID and persist the cursor only after consumption.
The advanced cursor suppresses already delivered results across reconnects and
host restarts. Retrying an unacknowledged cursor is deliberately repeatable;
transport delivery by itself cannot guarantee exactly-once consumption. Retention
expiry or a rewritten transcript returns an explicit gap. It never replays work.

Text output is bounded to a caller-selected 4–64 KiB across all targets, with at
most 16 receipts per target/page. A truncated result is labelled; `availableBytes`
describes the retained excerpt, not invented original output size. Child source
truncation is preserved separately. The complete available conversation remains
in its existing saved history. The browser keeps up to eight recent excerpts per
watched target and bounded delivery state in tab-local session storage, independent
of the client ID that rotates on reload. It retries only failed reads after a
connection loss, never a follow-up or interruption.

Worker follow-up command receipts share the existing command store. A submission
that loses its acknowledgement remains `unknown`; retrying its command ID returns
that receipt without dispatching again. Unresolved receipts become unknown on
host restart, and persistent idle workers become interrupted because their old
runtime no longer owns them. Reopening the app does not restart them.

Every admitted `conversation.stop` increments the existing session's
`interruptionRevision` and records `lastInterruption {commandId, at, origin}`.
Worker stop does the same in its worker row. Duplicate command IDs do not advance
the revision twice. Scheduled adapters can bind and recheck this revision before
submission; internal runtime parking/reloading does not represent user stop intent.

## Portable boundary

`amplifier_operations.coordination` is a standard-library-only protocol in the
existing operations package. `delivery(snapshot, after_cursor, max_bytes,
max_results)` provides storage-neutral result cursors. `ChangeSignal.wait(read,
wait_ms)` provides bounded event notification and captures its event before
reading, avoiding a read/wait lost wakeup. The host owns storage, authority,
identities and lifecycle. The library does not import the app or run tools.

No loop-live dispatch setting changes. Programmatic dispatch remains opt-in.
No Work composition, dependency source pin, or release version changes.

## Validation

`pytest tests/test_coordination.py` covers multi-target waits, attribution,
attention, output bounds, gaps, cancellation, reconnect, restart, uncertain sends,
command idempotency, and agent scope. `tests/fixtures/standalone_children_probe.py`
also exercises real Foundation/Rust child sessions with a deterministic
orchestrator, including explicit message receipt IDs and report lifecycle.

`npm run test:coordination-browser --prefix frontend` runs an isolated production
service and production assets in Chromium. Its deterministic runtime supplies
worker events; it verifies two watched targets, a follow-up, reconnect,
interruption during a wait, draft/selection preservation, and mobile bounds.
This is actual service/browser coverage, not a claim of a live provider run or
deployed Work bundle acceptance.
